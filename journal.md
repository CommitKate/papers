# Title 
Model- measurement comparison of aircraft measurements of secondary organic aerosol over West Africa.

# Abstact
How do particles form from forest fire emissions?

# Intro
We present measurements of SOA blahhh. J. Bloggs et all already took some measurements, but they haven't answered all the scientific questions. Of course, J. Smith et al made some great measurements in the 1980s in this region.

# Methodology
We used an aersol mass spectrometer to measure aerosol composition and mass (Allen at al 2004).

# Simulations
John has a great model which simulates particle formation from forest fire emissions.

# Results
We got valuable insight into the particle formation process.

# Conclusions
Aren't we great we found out some stuff.

# Figures
This is where the figures live

We thank the EU for the funding grant. RIP(?) :(
